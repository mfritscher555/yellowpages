## Files to Look At
The _scraper.py file was the ultimate file used to do the web scraping and the nola_output_revised.csv represents the final output generated.


## What to Run in the Terminal
Once I was cd'd into the appropriate directory, and made the appropriate imports in my virtual environment, I was ready to run the scraper. 
The command was:

```(yellowpages) $ scrapy crawl neworleans```
