# yellowpages

## Files to Look At
The _scraper.py file was the ultimate file used to do the web scraping and the nola_output_revised.csv represents the final output generated (the difference in the revised output file being that it drops duplicate records). 


## What to Run in the Terminal
Once I was cd'd into the appropriate directory, and made the appropriate imports in my virtual environment, I was ready to run the scraper. 
The command was:

```(yellowpages) $ scrapy crawl nola```

"nola" comes from the _scraper.py file where I defined the name of the spider to be nola.
